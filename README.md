# AI-Based Traffic Signal Automation

## Overview
This project aims to develop a smart traffic management system that dynamically adjusts traffic light timings based on real-time traffic data. The system leverages AI and machine learning to optimize traffic flow, reduce congestion, and improve road efficiency.

## Features
- **Real-Time Traffic Analysis**: Uses computer vision and sensors to analyze vehicle density at intersections.
- **Dynamic Signal Control**: Adjusts signal durations based on real-time traffic data to minimize wait times.
- **AI-Based Decision Making**: Implements machine learning algorithms to predict congestion and optimize flow.
- **Emergency Vehicle Priority**: Detects emergency vehicles and provides them with a clear passage.

## Technologies Used
- **Machine Learning**: Used for traffic pattern prediction and optimization.
- **Computer Vision**: Implemented with OpenCV and YOLO for vehicle detection.
- **Google Colab**: Used for training and running the machine learning model.
- **Python**: Primary language for AI models and processing.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
- Google Colab account
- Python libraries: OpenCV, TensorFlow, NumPy, Pandas

### Steps to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/traffic-signal-automation.git
   cd traffic-signal-automation
   ```
2. Open the Colab notebook in Google Colab.
3. Install required dependencies in the Colab notebook:
